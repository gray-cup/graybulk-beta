          Coldran is a customer intelligence platform built to help product
          teams stop guessing what their users want. We collect feedback from
          wherever customers already are — Discord, Slack, email, your website
          — and surface what actually matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most feedback tools are passive. They wait for customers to fill out
          a form. Coldran uses AI agents to actively gather, classify, and
          synthesize feedback into a knowledge base your whole team can act on.
          Bugs become GitHub issues. Feature requests get triaged. Patterns
          emerge before they become churn.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're early and moving fast. The product is in beta, which means
          things break, features ship rough, and we talk directly to every
          customer. That's intentional.
